Subject: TERRIBLE SERVICE - DEMAND REFUND NOW!!!

I am absolutely FURIOUS with your company! The product I received is completely broken and your customer service is AWFUL. I have been waiting 2 weeks for a response and this is UNACCEPTABLE!

I want to speak to your manager immediately and if this isn't resolved today, I will be contacting my lawyer and posting negative reviews everywhere!

This is the WORST experience I've ever had!

Angrily,
